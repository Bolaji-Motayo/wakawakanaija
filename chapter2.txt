The Finance Act 2021 ("FA 2021") was passed by the National Assembly and signed into law by the President on December 31, 2021.

Nigeria experienced its deepest recession in two decades in 2020, but growth resumed in 2021 as pandemic restrictions were eased, oil prices recovered, and the authorities implemented policies to counteract the economic shock. Nigeria was extremely vulnerable to the global economic disruption caused by COVID-19, particularly due to the drop in oil prices. Oil accounts for more than 80% of exports, one-third of banking sector credit, and half of government revenue. In 2018, 40% of Nigerians (83 million people) were poor, while another 25% (53 million) were vulnerable. The number of Nigerians living below the international poverty line is expected to rise by 12 million between 2019 and 23.
