Nigeria, located in West Africa along the Gulf of Guinea on the Atlantic Ocean, is a federal constitutional republic made up of 36 states and its Federal Capital Territory, Abuja. Nigeria's official language is English, and its currency is the naira (NGN).

Nigeria became Africa's largest economy after rebasing in 2014. According to data from the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics, the gross domestic product (GDP) for 2018 is estimated to be 397 billion US dollars (USD).



Nigeria, as a developing country, has been identified by prominent members of the global investment community and economists as an up-and-coming market with tremendous growth potential over the next decades.

Nigeria, a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) since 1971, is Africa's largest oil producer and the world's eleventh largest. In addition to oil and gas, Nigeria has vast untapped mineral resources such as coal, bauxite, gold, and iron ore. The country's natural resources have piqued the interest of the world's largest oil and gas companies, as well as businesses in allied industries such as oil field equipment and services, transportation and logistics, and petrochemicals and plastics.

Nigeria, the world's seventh most populous country, is rapidly expanding its infrastructure and attracting foreign and domestic investment from major players in the engineering and construction industries, as well as the telecommunications sector.
